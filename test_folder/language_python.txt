Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[26] Van Rossum led the language community until July 2018.[27][28]

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python features a comprehensive standard library, and is referred to as "batteries included".[29]

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open-source software[30] and has a community-based development model. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation. 
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[42] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[43] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[44][45] and logic programming.[46]

Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets and generator expressions.[47] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[48]

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[49]

    Beautiful is better than ugly
    Explicit is better than implicit
    Simple is better than complex
    Complex is better than complicated
    Readability counts
